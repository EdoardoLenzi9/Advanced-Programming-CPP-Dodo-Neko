# Jekyll quick start

this page is dynamically generated with jekyll. to make any sense of it, see the [Quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

to run jekyll, you need to install ruby-full, build-essential and zlib1g-dev. after you manually installed those via apt, run the install script with sudo, then the make script as normal user.

After the compilation is successful, a static version of the page is generated in the `_site`-folder - which should be copied to `web`
