### Default response codes

A list of common server response codes. The descriptions are only a general idea. For the actual error message, use your own description and throw it into the `status.description` field of the default response.

|Code | State | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 200 | success | Everything was done according to request |
| 401 | failure | Request not possible, authentication required or auth level too low. Also returned when authentication fails on the `/user/auth` endpoint. |
| 406 | failure | failed to parse JSON |
| 501 | failure | not implemented, returned when accessing an invalid endpoint |
